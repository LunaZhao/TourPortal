today we start to implement a APP for DAV Karlsruhe TourPortal, to help us to get some knowledge of develope the android application
deadline 07.2025 :)

software to install
- android studio
- Java developement kit(JDK) link: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
- SDK for android studio, i have done these before but now i forget what i have installed, you have to find out on this part.
- install git
- set up git on android studio
- i have created the repository for the project, please use the branch master

on the repository, i have already coded some stuff, and it could not build successfully, because there are missing methodes.
you could find them on this video list.

he uses firebase cloud supported by google, i think you probably could not access google.
but i think, currently we could just use the our own local pc to save the data, after we finish all the functionalities, we could 
think about how to use a cloud as server and continue to work on.
